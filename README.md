*a lite social network for simple posts*


**To-do:**
* Code out the messaging tab to show the user people they have actually followed
* Build functionality for the messaging section to be searchable by user
* Add functionality for the messaging section to only the people the user has followed or messaged
* Create functionality to see a user profile via search, posts, and messaging
* Add functionality to block users
* Decide what to do with the left menu (Add to/remove it?)
* Create functionality to specify post type and set the text editor to change based on the post type(?)
* Fix the way posts display according to the post type. Currently, the title does not show and there are image display issues.
* Display posts in the correct order on all pages. Main page currently shows oldest to newest.
* Build out the main search functionality. It will most likely need its own page. Make sure the results display posts and users in an appropriate order
* Remove or gray out login via Facebook and Google
* Create a sample login for users to try out
* Implement the option to see all latest posts, or just your own personalized feed
* Impose limits to characters in text fields
* Fix the intro text not showing up on text posts
* Figure out the use for the key property and index parameter again in the Posts component
* Work on responsive stylings and descriptive comments in the CSS
